OpenCloud--A DIY at-home cloud made entirely from open-source code.
Why?

* At home cloud technology is expensive, even the cheapest home cloud will fetch for $150 easily
* All at home clouds rely on third-party connection software (who knows what actually happens to your data)
* There is a definite need for off-device file saving, but many people don't trust big-name companies with their data

Requirements:

* must be able to connect to a secure wifi-connection
* must be able to both transmit and recieve data
* data must be sent encrypted and decrypted on reception
* must have application for any supported devices (Windows, MacOS, IOS, Android, etc)
* must be configurable such that any size HDD or SSD will work with our code
* hardware must cost less than $150 for every 2-3 TB of storage

Possible additions:

* automatic git workflow control as a work server?
