# General Concept

This project would be a table (coffee-table sized?) which is actually a "smart surface".
Userse would be able to use special pens to draw/write on it as if it was a white board.

This would allow many useful things. Coloring/Doodling; drawing boundaries for a table-top game;
jotting down quick notes; leaving reminders for other family member; etc.
